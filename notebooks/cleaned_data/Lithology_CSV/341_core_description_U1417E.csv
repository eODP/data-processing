- typical cycle:
- 5GY 4/1 (greyish) mud, <2 cm (top)
- 5Y 3/1 (greenish) mud, <2 cm
- 10Y 4/1 (brownish) mud, up to 15 cm
- 10Y 4/1 (brownish) laminated mud with single sand grains, up to 13.5 cm (bottom)

- colour changes between differently coloured intervals are typically gradational, but the transition from greyish to brownish deposits either mud or muddy silt ('start of a new cycle') can occasionally be sharp (and erosive)

- silty/muddy laminated intervals:
- does not always occur
- thickest sequence from 60.5-74 cm in sect. 1; usually 1 mm - 5 cm thick
- lower boundary sharp when preserved
- gradational upper boundary
- thicker intervals often sheared off at at their beds
- very occasional compressive tectonic features (e.g. sect. 2, ~76-80 cm)and 'flame structures'/load structures (e.g. sect. 3, ~87-90)

- if silty/muddy intervals are not present, the boundary between greyish and brownish intervals is sharp & irregular/straight, e.g. sect. 1, 28 cm; sect. 2, 36.5 cm

- several pyritized burrows between 7-21 cm in section 1.
