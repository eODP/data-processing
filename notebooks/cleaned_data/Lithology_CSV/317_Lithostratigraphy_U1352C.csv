Wavy very thin laminations are present.  This lithotype is heavily bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 4), with burrows of various diameters.  The burrows are light gray (5Y 7/1) micaceous and carbonaceous vf sandy calcareous mudstones.  Rare calcareous blebs are found throughout. 
Type 2: The second most common lithotype (16%) is a dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1) micaceous vf sandy calcareous mudstone with pronounced and abundant wavy horizontal to sub horizontal discontinuous laminations.  This lithotype contains common calcareous blebs and pale gray vf-f sand filled burrows that are sometimes elongated in a horizontal direction. This lithotype is moderately  bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 3).
Type 3: The third and least common lithotype (3%) is a greenish gray (10Y 5/1) moderately sorted vf-f (mostly vf) planar to ripple cross laminated calcareous sandstone.  Ripples are < 2 cm thick  and have micaceous and carbonaceous layers along cross laminae.  This lithotype is not bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 1).

Type 1:The most common lithotype (81%) is a greenish gray (10Y 5/1) well-sorted vf-f (most f) slightly micaceous sandy marlstone.  This lithotype tends to have gradational upper and lower contacts.  Carbonaceous, discontinuous wavy laminae (<1 mm thick) are rare. Wavy very thin laminations with fine sandy mud partings are present. It is moderately bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 3), but wavy laminations overprint burrow shapes.  Rare calcareous blebs are found throughout. 

Type 2: The second most common lithotype (16%) is a dark greenish gray (10Y 4/1) well sorted micaceous vf-f (most vf) sandy marlstone with pronounced and abundant wavy horizontal to sub horizontal discontinuous laminations of fine sandy mud partings. This lithotype contains common calcareous blebs. This lithotype is moderately bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 3).

Type 3: The third and least common lithotype (3%) is a dark greenish gray (10Y 3/1) well sorted vf-f (mostly vf) planar laminated calcareous sandstone interlaminated with vf sandy calcareous mudstone.  This lithotype is not bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 1).

Type 1:The most common lithotype (74%) is a greenish gray (N6 to 10Y 6/1) well-sorted vf-f (most vf) slightly glauconitic sandy marlstone.  This lithotype tends to have sharp upper and lower contacts. It is heavily bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 4), with light tan colored vf muddy sand filled burrows.  Very thin wavy laminations overprint burrow shapes.  

Type 2: A minor lithotype is a dark greenish gray (10Y 4/1) well sorted vf-f (most vf) calcareous sandy mudstone with wavy horizontal to sub horizontal discontinuous laminations of fine sandy mud partings. This lithotype is moderately bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 3).

Type 3: A minor lithotype is a dark gray (N4 ) well sorted vf-f (mostly f) planar to ripple laminated glauconitic calcareous sandstone.  This lithotype is not bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 1) and has sharp contacts.

Type 4: The second most common lithotype is a dark greenish gray (5GY 4/1 ) well sorted vf to f (mostly vf) massive to finely horizontally laminated calcareous sandstone.  Typically forms laminations up to 7 mm thick and typically has sharp contacts.

Type 5: A minor lithotype is a very dark greenish gray (10Y 3/1) laminated claystone with trace amounts of organic matter.  This lithotype is not bioturbated (ichnofabric index of 1) and has sharp contacts.
